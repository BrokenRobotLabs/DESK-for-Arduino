# DESK-for-Arduino
This is the main file for the DESK for Arduino project by Garrett Mathese(aka Broken Robot Labs) 

You will need to download and install the JArduino library and install it into Netbeans as well as any other libraries it realies on, such as the RXTX library for java. All other libraries used are built in to Netbeans.
